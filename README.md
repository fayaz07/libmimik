# LibMimik

**DISCONTINUED**
This repo was supposed to be acting like a shared native library between Mimik-macOS(https://github.com/fayaz07/mimik) and Mimik-windows(https://github.com/fayaz07/mimik-windows), but I am not even a mid-level engineer with C++ and I have had some tough time with building bindings, sync native lib and host(Swift), memory management is another overhead, so I decided to not have a shared library even if it's tougher in longer run, until someone decides to fix things up and time changes.
